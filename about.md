We travel the world in search of beautiful rough mineral speciments to make into Cabochons. Along the way be find unique one of a kind mineral specimens of many different types that we pass on to our collecting customers. Once we get home we get to work in our mountain home cutting unique cabochons from the most beautiful sections of the rough we have collected. <br>

Every week we make our new specimens available first to our existing customers<br> We treasure the close relationship we have with our maker customers who fashion the cabochons we send them into exquisite pieces of art that are unique.
