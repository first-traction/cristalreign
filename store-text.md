		Our studio is located in Truckee, California in the United States. CRISTAL REIGN is a small company show. We handcraft each item you see in my shop. These are all original pieces unless otherwise noted. We regard our work as our one true passion other than my loving husband and daughters. We work on each order separately. There is no production line and the quality of each piece will reflect that whether it is $20 or $150,000+.

		Shipping Domestic:
		All items purchased will be shipped via Domestic USPS Priority Mail. All items come with confirmation #'s. If you woud like to purchase insurance please convo me and we will discuss the details of insuring any item, but it does need to be done from a separate listing. Any uninsured items are at the customer's risk, but USPS Priority Mail has been 100% reliable to date. If you have any pressing shipping issues that are not informed in advance (ie: mail boxes in apt. buildings houses w/o secure mailboxes, unavailable to pick up, please let me know). 

		International Shipping:
		I welcome international orders! 
		International buyers please convo me your location for shipping costs. Any taxes or customs costs are up to the buyer. We will calculate costs for you and make a listing customized for your country.
		I will not send out any package unless it is registered mail or Priority International etc. 

		Paying the extra $6-$9 for shipping is advised as We put in a lot of hours to make a piece(s). It not only hurts you to lose a package in the mail, it hurts me. We treat every item as if it were the only piece We make. We take great care to make any item, please respect that We feel very strongly about making sure the item is safely sent.

		You would not like it if you paid $3 USD and did not receive a $100 item. Therefore, We WILL NOT send out any parcel without verification or tracking #. 

		Shipping to ALL International Countries and Austria, Germany, France, UK, Ireland Japan etc. country specific with taxes and duties MUST be paid for by customer. Due to numerous sales outside of the US, unless you convo me with your country-- We WILL HAVE ALL RIGHTS TO CANCEL A SALE. 

		I cannot cover the cost of all my materials and labor and also pay for shipping costs to a foreign country. All my items cannot be found anywhere else and my prices do not allow for me to pay extra shipping costs because the buyer (you) did not inform me before purchase of your international location.

		INSURANCE: 100% to date of all packages have all arrived safely. We will let you know via convo if any package becomes lost or (stolen). After any package is sent out it is absolutely out of my hands. There are no refunds on non-delivered or lost packages, since We provide confirmation #'s. 

		Please ask me about insurance. Most packages are not insured Priority Mail. This actually has worked out great. If you are at all concerned, please ask me to list a shipping price that includes insurance.

		Shipping Custom Orders:
		The prices for shipping high ticket items will be discussed on a client to client basis and will be sent out by the best shipping method chosen by me and the client. These orders will all have a private listing, so the shipping price will be calculated after the final design and metals/stones are chosen.

		Thank you for choosing
		Cristal Reign Fine Jewelry!

		********************************************************************************************
		GOLDEN RULES OF CUSTOM ORDERS:
		Due to the high fluctuations of gold and silver prices We will allow a 5 day period after estimates are given to list a custom listing. Otherwise, you cannot come to me a year later and expect the same prices originally estimated. We make SOLID pieces that are not hollowed out. Silver is now the cost of gold back in 2006 so please do not think that you will be receiving those prices as estimates. All pieces are made to order and We cannot at this time make samples for you in sterling silver. The costs for materials are very high. 

		ALL CUSTOM ORDERS HAVE A CURRENT WAIT PERIOD OF 2-4 MONTHS TO COMPLETE. PLEASE PLACE YOUR HOLDS ON CUSTOM ORDERS AS YOUR ORDERS WILL BE EXPEDITED AT THE TIME IT IS RECEIVED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE AND LOYALTY! All regular orders (not custom or gold etc. work) will be sent out within the normal 2.5 week period excluding vacation time.
		**********************************************************
		RINGS AND THINGS:
		Once a custom ring or final custom design is settled upon, the ring or design cannot be changed or modified. We have to go through a lot of channels to finish a design.
		I make every effort to take time to explain and send numerous emails and pictures so that there are no problems with any order.

		☛PAYMENT PLANS:
		*First Payment is 50% to 60% down depending on the order placed. The order must be paid for in FULL upon completion.

		☛Split Payments:✂✂✂✂✂✂✂✂
		For orders that are separated into more than 2 payments: Depending on the time period that passes in between the full completion of the order and last payment:

		✔*** An additional $25 USD will be added to the order total for each split payment if it is under $400 for the split payments. This is due to the numerous number of unpaid invoices that have to be managed and bills that need to be paid to run my studio monthly as well as insurance that your pieces will be kept safe in a vault for the specified period of time.

		✖CHANGES TO CUSTOM ORDERS BEFORE START OF FABRICATION:
		If you decide to change an order we settled upon, the charge is $50 to do another change which will be added to the final cost. This does not include any additional metal costs and or labor. It is just the time necessary to re do a custom made to order estimate.

		❤ONE OF A KIND ITEMS: Once the sale of a One of a Kind piece is made, it cannot be returned, exchanged or refunded. Unless there is faulty make (which there is never as a piece is checked and checked obsessively for defects), there will be no refunds or exchanges. We make every effort to post many photos and dimensions as well as descriptions of the One of A kind work. It is your responsibility to make sure that the item is your size. Each item is made with the utmost care for excellence. 
		✤Buyers remorse for One Of a Kind Pieces is not tolerated.:(
		I would rather you choose to custom make a piece than have a one of a kind item which is more than half off my custom order fees to list and send out, which is not exactly what you want. Complaints about fit will not be responded to as everything is specified in the listings. That is why We offer Custom Made to fit you exactly.

		☛SIZING: Nest Rings and Branch Rings cannot be sized. 
		I make every effort to re check multiple times before beginning work!!!
		☞If an agreement is reached between the client and Cristal Reign Jewelry of resizing/repair work-- please know that Cristal Reign Jewelry will NOT be responsible for any damages that come from repairs or sizing that is completed. The recommendation will always be to build a new piece. 
		Every piece of jewelry is built via fabrication-- it has multiple parts and is exceptionally difficult if not impossible to size. Your sizing request comes with HUGE risk-- a risk that is ultimately the responsibility of the owner. We can only do the best We humanly can. 
		If stones are damaged during a repair or resizing that is not recommended; that will be up to the buyer to call their insurance company to replace their stone(s). Purchase of items from Cristal ReignJewelry reflects your agreement and understanding of this and is disclosed before your purchase. Cristal Reign Jewelry will be committed to making things work, however, beyond the initial agreed upon jewelry that is delivered and created, any repair work due to client's error in size will be the responsibility of the client. 


		☆✿NO FEE FOR THE CONSULTATION PERIOD:
		There are no fees for the consultation period. 4 estimates can be asked for without a surcharge for asking for values to be estimated in different metals and configurations, please be kind and really think before asking me to do all the different calculations and whether your BUDGET would even permit me to work so hard for you. The prices are all different on my for sale page, see what range fits your budget. 

		If We see fit, We generally make at least 8-10 configurations for you, so please be kind as my time is worth a lot to me and We do spend all day and all night w/o sleep thinking of each and everyone of you personally.:) It's my job 24/7. If you really press my buttons and ask me to go beyond what is normal to do in this situation, We will have to charge extra to cover the extra superhuman hours to get a custom order straight and perfect for you. We made these over a lot of time and experience, please understand that We have the experience and design expertise to make some aesthetic decisions that may be the best choice. Please refrain from whittling away at me by asking me to make something that is technically impossible to do, done. We will say NO.

		❤UNPARALLELED SERVICE:
		Understand also that you won't ever get this kind of service anywhere. Detailed messages, process photos, handpicked stones, the whole nine yards.
		Estimating Prices is the most difficult portion of my job and yours--
		The "price" is the price. The more labor, the more you pay. The more gold, the more you pay etc. etc. LOL! :) Thanks for understanding.

		❤Disclaimers:
		I ask you to be respectful when convo-ing me your inquiry, and please do your research before asking for numerous over the top requests beyond the range We will be able to estimate for you as We do value the time We need to craft the pieces. 
		If you can't afford something in the shop, please do not ask for it to be made in brass. We do not construct in brass unless We have ready to wear items in my shop as it can taint the precious metals in my shop.

		*Custom orders in brass are not available as it is not cost effective for the labor. 

		❤PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH:
		*If a client is unable to look at previous work from my "sold" pages as well as the current photos on cristalreign.etsy.com and come to a determination of what they want exactly but then requires further mockup's or models that are not available or constructed, that charge is generally $50-$250 for a mockup of something that is custom created for show or as a model to be used as the final piece or made molds of. This is absent of the charge of the materials used.

		❤ORIGINAL IDEAS:
		If you have a really original thought, We may just make the model for free and present it. :) We like challenges even if We don't get paid for it. All original designs made in 3D are exclusively the rights of Cristal Reign Jewelry. 

		*If a sale does not go through and you have pictures of the models, Cristal Reign Jewelry reserves the right to pursue damages if the design is copied to 3D or on any other medium without consent.

		❤NEW DESIGNS CUSTOM WORK TIMELINE:
		*It sometimes takes 2 weeks or 6 months to 1 year to finalize a design. If you require a totally new design that is not offered in my shop, We will design, render and send the images to you. 

		*For other custom jobs (carved wax rings, fabrication, kinetic jewelry) each hour We charge upwards of $250hr to $750hr depending on the work We do for each client. Most clients are other jewelers who need fast turnaround and a huge markup on marketable and molded for production jewelry. 

		❧COPYRIGHT PROTECTED:
		*All designs are private and exclusively and inclusively the rights of  Cristal Reign Jewelry. We can choose to reuse the final design and modify it as We wish. We hold all copyrights to all original jewelry and any infringements like using my pictures, or renderings to send to another jeweler would be an infringement of that right, and We do wish ill will on anyone who would be so unfortunately uncreative in mind to do such a thing.
		*I do hold the rights to refuse a sale.


		❤COMFORT:
		Since this is an internet based sale, We like you to feel comfortable, but after final design and price is worked up and first payment received, We have to work up a new price every time a design is modified. All consultation hours are not considered when finalizing an estimate.

		Furthermore, any inquiries asking for a custom made setting/ rings/broaches, necklaces/earrings/pendants bracelets beyond what is set as photos or described will be subject to added customization charge.

		That said, these are very expensive for me to make and very time consuming. Every order We receive is very important to me and We want you to be happy with your finished piece. Any additional modifications to small or large order will be charged a flat $500 fee that does not include the additional costs of metals and labor. These charges will be extra. So be sure your size is correct and also your details.

		*Gold is not free, solder is not free, my studio overhead is not free. We do not discount as it is not in my nature to do this and do sloppy work just to get paid. 

		❤NO MONEY IS BETTER THAN HAGGLING:
		I'd rather not get paid or sell anything in order to keep making things. That is what We LOVE to do. So, my prices are solid and We try my best to accommodate everyone in a friendly and loving way. We am however a professional and this is my full time job, as well as a mother and a loving forever wife. 

		I do this work to create a love story and believe in love, let's keep it that way please. We hate to put my iron fist down.:( It's not fun to do.

		❤UPGRADING:
		If you buy a piece from me and want it upgraded We will do that happily, but don't expect it to be free or at cost. We know jeweler's who charge upwards of $50 to glue a plastic piece onto another plastic piece. If you know how to do this type of work and would like to tell me how to do my job, please go else where. It's NEVER a simple solder job. We don't tell you how to do your job, please refrain from telling me that my job is easy. It is not.

		If We were a painter and We was charging for paper and pen, for thousands of dollars We can understand the eyebrow raise, but We am working with precious materials and every day is a hazard for me when We enter the studio. We price all of the work in my shop as fairly as We know how. To date, there have been numerous copies made of my pieces, but We am the only one that does the kind of work you see in my shop. It's hard to do. Easy to try to copy, but China still hasn't figured out how to make money on all of the labor!


		Each piece is a masterpiece made exclusively for you.

		Thank you!

		Love Redefined in Your Storied Jewelry

		CRISTAL REIGN Jewelry was started from one single idea and a passion for metal smithing. The idea was born from my journey to finding "true and lasting love".

		We started making a line of jewelry to tell a story. It was, and still is about the struggles of the path to finding true love.

		Over the years, my business has flourished to "tell" other people's stories.

		The close contact my clients and I have during the process of a custom creation becomes so that I am merged with the couple for a number of months such that they become my friends. Their story, then comes alive in my studio as I work.

		I get up thinking of jewelry and fall asleep thinking of jewelry.

		Most nights are spent endlessly soldering, wax carving, playing with metals, stones, and designs. Days are spent rushing around in the city to procure only recycled metals as well as sustainable stones. Every piece is fabricated in my shop in Truckee, CA with recycled metals and Kimberly Agreement Friendly (diamonds, precious stones, semi precious stones). 

		Every single design is inspired by the lives of my clients as well as our own background as international rock collectors.

		ABOUT:

		Bruno is a Italian American, California native and having lived in New York City and Milan and native with a passion for hearing and telling stories. 

		An accomplished musician, actress, and restoration artist, her most cherished story is enveloped in her hand carved swallows. 

		The simple idea came about from hearing stories about losing love and gaining love and giving advice freely about holding it when we have it. 

		All along, they knew that the simplest task is always the greatest of tasks. Cherishing all the small magical moments and realizing that life is not always the way we imagine it to be, but remembering our souls throughout our daily lives and realizing what is beautiful in the complex world in which we live is the key. 

		With a hunger for hearing stories; epic stories, small snippets of conversations, love stories, sad stories, daily life stories- she collected a wealth of information hearing and learning from others: most were told to her just by way of observing and experiencing the world.

		Through those stories, Libby and Bruno wanted to encompass the good with the bad, the beautiful with the ugly to signify raw passion and pursuit of pure love. 

		When handcrafting in their studio in Truckee, NY, Bruno merges his Italian heritage and talent for observing and carving tiny details with her discordant very American/Euro style of just letting things evolve and “just be”. Their jewelry is an amalgam of music, poetry, sculpture, and quiet simplicity. 

		They have created pieces ranging from $200-$35,000 and up. But still scrubs the bathroom floors and picks up dog and cat poo as well as have changed hundreds of diapers for her 4.5 year old kid. 

		Yet, she makes her jewelry seem effortless by balancing the idea that nothing can be perfect, all things are judged in the eye of the beholder. 

		Scouring ancient texts, poetry, and symbols; the symbolic nature of swallows seemed to be the perfect representation that were modern, yet old enough to deliver the idea of love, freedom and hope in a very tangible way.


		Bruno and Libby have never been happier presenting a complete fusion of their philosophies and art with the understanding that something as ephemeral as an idea can give birth to permanence.

		The goal is to make forms that are completely balanced and pure. Driven by pure passion and attention to technical details, yet with the flair for making her imperfections be driven by intent, each piece is hand carved or fabricated straight from recycled metals in her Sierra's studio then ergonomically crafted using classical jewelry techniques and infused with lightness. All of the elements are original. 

		All Sustainable Materials are used.

		While working in the jewelry district with fine jewelry companies, Jennifer started her fine jewelry studio. This is Cristal Reign Jewelry.
